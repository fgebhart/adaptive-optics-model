
### Information

This repository contains all files of the 'Adaptive Optics Model'. This includes the python code, the 3D-models and the images used for GUI. Manufacturing the AO Model is part of my university final thesis. The manufacturing is now complete and the project can be examined at the 'Haus der Astronomy - Center of Astronomy Education and Outreach' in Heidelberg Germany.

### Content

The content of this repo is organized in two main parts:

*  python code: Main programs for live demonstration of adaptive optics, GUI programming and more stuff like stepper controlling, image recognition, date input/output.
*  3D-models: stl-files of all used parts. Used material was aluminium or 3d-printed pla. The base plate was manufatured of wood. All files are available on [thingiverse.com](http://www.thingiverse.com/fgebhart/collections/adaptive-optics-model)
